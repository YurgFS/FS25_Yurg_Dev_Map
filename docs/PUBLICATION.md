/!\ IMPORTANT /!\
THIS MAP IS ABSOLUTELY NOT DESIGNED FOR NORMAL CAREER PLAY MODE.

If you are not a modder, this map is unlikely to be useful for you.
Except perhaps to test certain mods that have a strong impact on a game before adding it to your main game.

Some ayatollahs, who believe that everyone should play like them, seem to have great fun giving a single star to any mod that does not interest them or does not seem real to them.
Therefore, do not hesitate to rate the mod after you have tested it, and/or contact us if something is not right for you.
