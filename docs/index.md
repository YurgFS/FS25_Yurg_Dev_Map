If you are not a modder, this map is unlikely to be useful for you.
Except perhaps to test certain mods that have a strong impact on a game before adding it to your main game.

## Why this map?

I know we can use some console commands like ggsI3DCacheClean, gsStoreItemsReload, gsVehicleReload

But in the end we often need to restart the game, reason why I decided to create a light, fast-loading map for mod testing.

## What does it offer?

It comes with:
- vehicle shop & animal dealer triggers
- a farm house, workshop, farmer's market and sawmill
- 6 golden apples that will give you 2M each if you need money
- 23 small fields (0.64 ha) for all crops ready to harvest
- 1 additional big field (2.60 ha) for cotton  ready to harvest
- 2 additional large long fields (4.64 ha) with grass & wheat ready to harvest
- 6 small fields (0.64 ha) for wheat at distinct growing, lime and fertilizer stages
- 3 long fields (0.60 ha) for olives at distinct growing stages
- 3 long fields (0.60 ha) for grapes at distinct growing stages
- 8 fields of different sizes with nothing on it to test implements
    - 1 huge field for consturctions (5.04 ha)
    - 3 small fields (0.64 ha)
    - 2 small flooded rice fields (0.64 ha)
    - 2 big fields (1.92 ha)
- trees at different growing stages & a few rocks
- missions are available (20 unowned fields for that purpose)
- some vehicles ready to use
